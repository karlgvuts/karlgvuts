    <p> w2i ;; whisper to interact ( i am a very shy person, so i suggest you to speak up first ) </p>
    <p> iwc ;; interact with care/caution ( i dont rlly put it in my name unless im crying or draining the shi out of me, js a quick reminder that i vent like most of the time. js in the silence not to ppl tho ) </p>
    <p> dni/tt/td ;; do not int / touch trigger / touch discomfort // i would sometimes put ts in my name as a joke, so feel free to troll me lol </p>
    <p> Ltm ;; listening to music </p>
    <p> tc ;; touch comfort </p>
    <p> c+h ;; cuddle and hide </p>
    <p> i love whenever someone cuddles me, so js c+h freely whenever you wanted, because thats okay with me!! (˵ •̀ ᴗ - ˵ ) </p>
    <p> if you ever think im away, dont hesitate to w2i mate  </p>
    <p> please do not try to engage rp w me, even if you do i will js simply hide you for 15 mins. the reason im saying ts is because im not very good at rp at all. but i might try again one day </p>
    <p> you may see me roaming around the map, or js sitting at some spots that i mostly sat, I am usually offtab, but dw i often check every 6-7 minutes </p>
    <p> I love placing lanterns, and yes if you see a table full of lanterns at outside of the bakery seating spot, that was me. I usually do it whenever im bored and i hope this didnt offend you.. i js love lanternnss..s...ok... 🥺🥺🥺 </p>
    <p> please aim to be nice whenever you want to have a conversation with me, if no then i wont be replying to your messages. I'm not very good at interacting since i have been a dry texter for years, and talking in an energetic way feels like im being forced../nm (ᵕ—ᴗ—) but im not rlly that mean, i can be very kind, joyful, and maybe cool i think.k.k.....ghulp. I'm also very slow to understand some stuff and I'll lyk whenever it went over my head (๑ᵔ⤙ᵔ๑) </p>
    <p> i am very active on ponytown, I'm online for around 2-15 hours. if i havent been on ponytown for a week nor a months, it means i have school/exams or on a huge hiatus.. Onlines on every weekend, holidays and maybe midnight, if i havent slept yet ofc </p>
